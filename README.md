# Wefox Code Challenge

![CI](https://github.com/raphaklaus/wefox/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg?event=push)

The solution is 100% dockerized. Here it is a summary of the commands:

## Running

By running the below, the application will start itself without needing extra `&& npm start` call. :)

```bash
  $ docker-compose up
```

## Testing

Because we care about our team's sanity :P

```bash
  $ server> npm test
  $ scheduler> npm test
```

## ðŸš€ GitHub Actions ðŸš€

Go to the `Actions` tab of this repo and check it the latest tests

To deploy this on AWS I would use ECS. So the steps are like this, on a high level:

* Get your credentials (key and secret)
* Create a profile
* Use ECS-CLI to create the cluster, selecting the region, instance type and size
* Deploy the compose file using the `compose up` of `ecs-cli`
* Preferably, you can run the service containers (Redis and MongoDB) in third-party services and point the host and credentials using environment variables in the ECS instance.
